    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target = "_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server of from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<img src=""></p>
    <pstyle="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTaml pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create sturctured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as heaings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTaml elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
